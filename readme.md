# Instant Joi Validation Feedback

## Learn Joi Basics through a friendly interface

https://joi.dev

While learning Joi to validate request bodies containing lots of fields I found myself going back and forth between postman and the terminal scrolling through loooong logs to see which fields did validate or not..   

I thought, wouldn't it be great to get instant validation feedback from Joi ?   
I have made this app so I could learn Joi and experiment with the numerous functions Joi offers out of the box. 

This is a simple Node app, using Pug as templating engine, the data is validated on the "server", the result of the validation is rendered and sent back to the user. It happens so fast it makes me happy üòÅ  !
